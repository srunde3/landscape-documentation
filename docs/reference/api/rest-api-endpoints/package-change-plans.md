# Package Change Plans

A package change plan stages a bulk package operation over a computer selection. Creating a plan resolves the selection into concrete computer/package pairs.

```{note}
You must be running Landscape Server 26.10 or later to use the REST API for package management.

This feature is available on self-hosted and **select accounts on SaaS**. It is not generally available to all SaaS accounts.
```

## POST `/package-change-plans`

Create a plan.

### Request body parameters

**Required:**

- `computer_query`: Query string selecting the target computers (same syntax as the `query` parameter on {ref}`reference-rest-api-computers`).

**Required--exactly one action config:**

- `install_config`: Install packages. See [`install_config`](install_config).
- `remove_config`: Remove packages. See [`remove_config`](remove_config).
- `hold_config`: Hold packages at their current version. See [`hold_config`](hold_config).
- `unhold_config`: Release held packages. See [`unhold_config`](unhold_config).
- `upgrade_config`: Upgrade packages. See [`upgrade_config`](upgrade_config).
- `change_version_config`: Move packages between specific versions. See [`change_version_config`](change_version_config).

### Response fields

- `id`: UUID of the new plan.
- `action`: The package operation. One of `install`, `remove`, `hold`, `unhold`, `upgrade`, `change_version`.
- `state`: Current plan state. Known values are `pending`, `generating`, `ready`, `executing`, `executed`, `failed`, `expired`.
- `created_at`: ISO 8601 timestamp of when the plan was created.
- `expires_at`: ISO 8601 timestamp when a `ready` plan expires, or `null` in other states.
- `item_count`: Number of computer/package pairs the plan targets, or `null` if content hasn't been generated.
- `executed_at`: ISO 8601 timestamp of execution, or `null` if the plan hasn't been executed.
- `activity_id`: ID of the activity created by execution, or `null` if the plan hasn't been executed.
- `error_code`: Error code when the plan is in the `failed` state, or `null` otherwise.
- `error_message`: Error message when the plan is in the `failed` state, or `null` otherwise.

The plan is created in the `pending` state and will become `ready` once the plan is fully generated. Use `GET /package-change-plans/<id>` to poll until the plan is ready.

### Limits

Landscape enforces limits on the number of selected computers and the number of distinct resolved target package IDs. Requests to create change plans that exceed either of these limits return a `too_many_instances` or `too_many_packages` error.

TODO: add specific limits

### Quotas

Landscape SaaS applies an account quota based on plan items created in the previous 24 hours. There is no quota on self-hosted deployments. Requests to create change plans that exceed the daily quota will return a `quota_exceeded` error.

TODO: add specific limit

### Creation errors

- `400 Bad Request`: `invalid_computer_query`, `too_many_instances`, `too_many_packages`, `quota_exceeded`, `unknown_packages`, or `invalid_version_change`.

Error responses use the standard API error response:

```json
{

  "message": "The computer query is invalid.",
  "detail": null
}

## GET `/package-change-plans`

List the package change plans created by the authenticated user.

Query parameters:

- `states`: Comma-separated plan states. The endpoint returns plans that match any listed state. Known values are `pending`, `generating`, `ready`, `executing`, `executed`, `failed`, and `expired`. If omitted, the endpoint returns plans in every state.
- `limit`: Maximum number of plans to return (default: `50`, maximum: `100`).
- `offset`: Offset into the result list (default: `0`).

Plans are ordered by creation time, newest first. Plans with the same creation time are ordered by ID in descending order.

Example request:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://landscape.canonical.com/api/v2/package-change-plans?states=ready,failed&limit=50&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT"
```

Example response (200 OK):

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "action": "install",
      "state": "ready",
      "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:00:00+00:00",
      "expires_at": "2026-01-16T10:00:05+00:00",
      "item_count": 50,
      "executed_at": null,
      "activity_id": null,
      "error_code": null,
      "error_message": null
    }
  ],
  "next": null,
  "previous": null
}
```

Response fields:

- `count`: Total number of plans that match the request before pagination.
- `results`: Matching plans. Each entry has the same fields as a single package change plan response.
- `next`: Relative URL for the next page, or `null` when there isn't one.
- `previous`: Relative URL for the previous page, or `null` when there isn't one.

Invalid state or pagination values return `400 Bad Request`.

## GET `/package-change-plans/<id>`

Retrieve a plan's status and metadata. Unknown IDs return `404`.

Clients should stop status polling on `ready`, `executed`, `failed`, or `expired`. Treat `pending`, `generating`, `executing`, and unrecognized states as still in progress.

`executed` means the activity was created. Use the activity status to track package execution.

A plan expires 24 hours after entering `ready`. Plans in `executed`, `failed`, or `expired` are removed 24 hours after entering that state.

Items, summaries, and exclusions are readable only while a plan is `ready`, `executing`, or `executed`. These endpoints return `409` with `invalid_plan_state` and the current `state` otherwise.

Path parameters:

- `id`: The UUID of the plan.

Query parameters:

- None

Example request:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://landscape.canonical.com/api/v2/package-change-plans/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT"
```

Example response (200 OK), for a plan that has been executed:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "action": "install",
  "state": "executed",
  "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:00:00+00:00",
  "expires_at": null,
  "item_count": 50,
  "executed_at": "2026-01-15T10:05:00+00:00",
  "activity_id": 42,
  "error_code": null,
  "error_message": null
}
```

### Retrieval errors

Unknown plan IDs return `404 Not Found` with the standard error object.

## POST `/package-change-plans/<id>:execute`

Execute a plan, creating activities for every targeted computer.

Path parameters:

- `id`: The UUID of the plan.

Query parameters:

- None

Request body:

- None

This endpoint is idempotent: the second call returns the activity created by the first.

Only `ready` and `executed` plans can be executed. Other states return `409` with `invalid_plan_state`; a `ready` plan with no items returns `409` with `empty_plan`. If another operation changes the state concurrently, execution returns `409` with `transition_conflict`; retry the request to act on the current state. If the retained activity no longer exists, an `executed` plan returns `404` with `activity_not_found` without dispatching another activity.

A dispatch failure marks the plan `failed` and returns `500` with `execution_timeout` or `internal_error`.

### Execution errors

- `409 Conflict`: `invalid_plan_state` when the plan cannot be executed, or `empty_plan` when a ready plan has no items.
- `404 Not Found`: `activity_not_found` when an executed plan's retained activity no longer exists.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: `dispatch_timeout` or `internal_error` when dispatch fails.

Each error is returned as the standard error object. An `invalid_plan_state` response also includes the plan's current `state`:

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_plan_state",
  "message": "The plan cannot be executed in its current state.",
  "detail": {
    "state": "generating"
  }
}
```

Example request:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://landscape.canonical.com/api/v2/package-change-plans/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000:execute" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT"
```

Example response (200 OK):

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "summary": "Install, hold and/or remove packages",
  "type": "ActivityGroup",
  "deliver_delay_window": 0,
  "creator": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "activity_status": "undelivered"
}
```

The response is the parent activity tracking the whole execution. Child activities are created per computer.

## GET `/package-change-plans/<id>/items`

List the computer/package pairs in a plan.

Path parameters:

- `id`: The UUID of the plan.

Query parameters:

- `computer_ids`: Comma-separated computer IDs to filter by.
- `computer_instance_name`: Case-insensitive prefix match on a computer's instance name.
- `install`, `remove`, `hold`, `unhold`: Package ID to match for the corresponding plan action.
- `upgrade`: Destination package ID to match for an upgrade plan.
- `change_version`: JSON object with `from_package_id` and `to_package_id` to match for a change-version plan.
- `limit`: Maximum number of items to return (default: `50`, maximum: `1000`).
- `offset`: Offset into the result list (default: `0`).

Set at most one action filter, and use the filter matching the plan's action. Invalid or mismatched action filters return `400` with `filter_mismatch`.

### Item-list errors

- `400 Bad Request`: `filter_mismatch` for invalid or mismatched action filters.
- `404 Not Found`: when the plan does not exist.
- `409 Conflict`: `invalid_plan_state` when plan contents are unavailable in the plan's current state.

Example request:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://landscape.canonical.com/api/v2/package-change-plans/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/items" \
